#Drivers and software

A repo containing all of my drivers and software for strange and\or legacy peripherals, as well as unsupported use case for standard peripherals and hardware

# UCR is used for controller remapping
vJoy is more or less a UCR dependency

the context.xml file is a running backup of all of my UCR profiles such as the joy > shifter profile and things of that nature. these will need to be edited to use with your devices and are really just templates.
