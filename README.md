# Drivers and software

A repo containing all of my drivers and software for strange and\or legacy peripherals, as well as unsupported use cases for standard peripherals and hardware

# UCR is used for controller remapping
vJoy is more or less a UCR dependency

The context.xml file is a running backup of all of my UCR profiles such as the joy > shifter profile and things of that nature. These will need to be edited to use with your devices and are really just templates.

# FFShifter is used to emulate an H-pattern shifter with a FFB flight stick

This one is actually really interesting. I originally found it on a website created by the developer years ago and later found a post about it on the LFS forum. I use it with UCR in a proper H-shifters stead. The rar found in this repository contains multiple pre-configured profiles. You can choose one that suits you or you can use the built in editor or your IDE of choice to create your own profiles. Theres ZERO documentation that I was able to find, however the README file may contain some valuable information if you spend the time to read through. I havent spent the time to do so.
